## Overview

The Spam Classifier is designed to identify spam messages by analyzing text data and making predictions based on various machine learning techniques. It utilizes a **TF-IDF vectorizer** to process and transform the text data and a **Naive Bayes classifier** (MultinomialNB) to make predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8 or later**
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning models
- **NLTK**: Text preprocessing and tokenization
- **Streamlit**: UI for the spam classifier
- **Pickle**: Save and load trained models and vectorizers

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Spam Classifier on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-classifier.git
   cd spam-classifier
